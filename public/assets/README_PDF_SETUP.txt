To use your Google Certificate PDF template with this application:

   b) RENAME it to exactly: "Google Certificate .pdf" 
      (Important: Include the space before ".pdf")
   c) COPY the renamed file into this exact location:
      📁 /public/assets/Google Certificate .pdf

2. 📂 CURRENT FOLDER CONTENTS:
   - ✅ README_PDF_SETUP.txt (this file)
   - ❌ Google Certificate .pdf (MISSING - You need to add this)

3. 🔧 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
   Once you add the PDF file, the certificate generation will:
   - Load your existing PDF design
   - Overlay the student's name in the center
   - Add completion date, course details, and instructor info
   - Download as a personalized certificate

   The text will be positioned at these coordinates on your PDF:
   - Student name: Center of page
   - Course: Below name
   - Instructor details: Below course
   - Date & ID: Bottom areas
   
   If text doesn't align properly, you can adjust positions in CertificatePage.jsx
